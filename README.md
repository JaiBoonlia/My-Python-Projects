# 1. Agricultural Production Data Analysis
# Overview
This project performs comprehensive data analysis on agricultural production to extract key insights and support better decision-making. The analysis involves handling real-world agricultural data and leveraging Python to answer critical agricultural metrics and trends.

# Features
The project is designed to solve the following problems:<br>

Calculate the Total Yield by Crop Type.<br>
Determine the Average Price by Crop Type.<br>
Identify High-Yield Crops by Region.<br>
Compute the Total Revenue by Region.<br>
Find the Most Profitable Crop in Each Region.<br>
Pinpoint the Region with the Highest Total Yield.<br>
Summarize Yearly Production for a Crop.<br>
Sort Regions by Average Price.<br>
Add New Crop Data.<br>
Identify the Highest and Lowest Prices for a Crop.<br>
Classify Underperforming Crops.<br>
# Dataset
The dataset (agri.csv) includes agricultural data such as:<br>
Date of entry<br>
Crop type<br>
Region of production<br>
Production yield (in metric units)<br>
Price per unit of the crop<br>
# Core Techniques:
Data structures: Lists, sets, and dictionaries<br>
Python operators, loops, and conditionals<br>
Modular functions for specific tasks<br>
Libraries:
(Optional) For extended functionality, libraries like Pandas and NumPy can be used.

# Each subproblem provides:
Summarized insights like total yield or average prices.<br>
Rankings or filtered data by yield, region, or profit.<br>
Easy addition and verification of new data entries.<br>
