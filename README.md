# 1. Agricultural Production Data Analysis
# Overview
This project performs comprehensive data analysis on agricultural production to extract key insights and support better decision-making. The analysis involves handling real-world agricultural data and leveraging Python to answer critical agricultural metrics and trends.

# Features
The project is designed to solve the following problems:<br>
Calculate the Total Yield by Crop Type.<br>
Determine the Average Price by Crop Type.<br>
Identify High-Yield Crops by Region.<br>
Compute the Total Revenue by Region.<br>
Find the Most Profitable Crop in Each Region.<br>
Pinpoint the Region with the Highest Total Yield.<br>
Summarize Yearly Production for a Crop.<br>
Sort Regions by Average Price.<br>
Add New Crop Data.<br>
Identify the Highest and Lowest Prices for a Crop.<br>
Classify Underperforming Crops.<br>
# Dataset
The dataset (agri.csv) includes agricultural data such as:<br>
Date of entry<br>
Crop type<br>
Region of production<br>
Production yield (in metric units)<br>
Price per unit of the crop<br>
# Core Techniques:
Data structures: Lists, sets, and dictionaries<br>
Python operators, loops, and conditionals<br>
Modular functions for specific tasks<br>
Libraries:
(Optional) For extended functionality, libraries like Pandas and NumPy can be used.

# How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.<br>
Place the dataset (agri.csv) in the root directory.<br>
Run the main analysis script<br>
Follow the prompts or check the output in the console/log files.<br>
# Each subproblem provides:
Summarized insights like total yield or average prices.<br>
Rankings or filtered data by yield, region, or profit.<br>
Easy addition and verification of new data entries.<br>

# 3. Movie Ticket Booking System
# Overview
The Movie Ticket Booking System is a Python-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to book movie tickets seamlessly. The system integrates real-time seat availability, pricing, and user-friendly interactions for selecting movies, showtimes, and dates.

# Features
Movie Selection: Allows users to choose movies from a dropdown list.<br>
Showtime Selection: Users can specify the date and time of the show from available options.<br>
Seat Booking: Enables ticket booking with real-time seat availability checks.<br>
Booking Confirmation:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays details such as the movie name, date, time, and ticket count.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computes and shows the total cost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Updates seat availability in the database.<br>
Input Validation:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alerts users if seat availability is insufficient.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides feedback for incorrect or unmet selections.<br>
Reset Functionality: Lets users clear all inputs to restart the process.<br>
# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python 3.10 or above
GUI Framework: tkinter
Data Handling: CSV file integration for movie and ticket data
# Workflow
Data Loading:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movie details such as name, date, time, available seats, and ticket price are loaded from a CSV file (movies.csv).<br>
Booking Logic:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program calculates the total cost based on ticket count and price.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Updates available seats after successful bookings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notifies the user in case of unavailability or input errors.<br>

# How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.<br>
Ensure the movies.csv file is in the same directory as the program script.<br>
Run the script:<br>
Interact with the application to book your tickets:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a movie, date, time, and number of tickets.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirm the booking or reset your selections as needed.<br>
